# Restaurant Rating Analysis and Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to gain insights into customer preferences, ratings, and trends. The dataset includes various attributes such as location, cuisine type, price range, and customer ratings. The goal is to clean the data, explore key patterns, and build a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on available features.

### 🔍 Key Objectives
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing unwanted symbols, and converting data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends in restaurant ratings, customer preferences, and geographical distribution.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting new insights from existing data, such as name/address length and encoding categorical variables.
- Machine Learning Model: Building and evaluating different regression models to predict restaurant ratings.

### 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Plotly

### 📊 Key Insights from Analysis
- Identified top-rated restaurants, cuisines, and cities.
- Analyzed the impact of price range and online delivery availability on ratings.
- Explored correlations between restaurant locations and their ratings.

### 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
